## General Information
- 'simple_flow_visualization.py' is the Python file that contains the GUI
- 'input.ui' is the UI file created with Qt Designer
- 'gui_generator.py' is a Python file that is run to convert 'input.ui' into a Python file
- 'output.py' is the Python file that was converted from the UI file

Qt Designer is used to quickly iterate any visible parts of the design. The actual code for the flow visualization is then appended and the code is then integrated.

## Usage

## Developer Installation
conda install -c anaconda pyqt
